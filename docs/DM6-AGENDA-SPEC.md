# DM6 Agenda SPEC
Create a top-level DM6 Agenda SPEC (wherever you prefer; e.g. in a dedicated dm6-agenda repo or in wow/docs/DM6-AGENDA-SPEC.md) with:

Purpose: “DM6 Agenda is the coordination layer connecting DMX, GT, Elm/FedWiki, and WOW.”
Projects table: columns = Project / Repo / Primary Doc / Runtime.
Agents table: Agent / Responsibilities / Typical inputs / Typical outputs.

Then link that SPEC from /view/dm6-agenda as “canonical description”.
